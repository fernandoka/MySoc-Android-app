# MySoc-Android-app
This app take part in the development of my final university project, providing an external GUI interface to comunicate with the digital piano (implemented in a FPGA as System On Chip). This communication is done using the bluethooth.

This app is divided in three diferents windows: Connection, File transfer, Keyboard. You can acces each of this windows using the navigation menu located at the bottom of the device screen.

 -> Connection: This window allow the user to establish a bluethooth connection with the digital piano. The user can also disconnect                       from the device using this window.

 -> File Transfer: This window allow the user to upload a MIDI file to the digital piano, only if the user have already established a                        bluethooth connection with It. The user can also define the maximun number of tracks for the next MIDI file to be                          uploaded. 

 -> Keyboard: This window show an octave of a piano, allowing the user to play these notes using the digital piano. To play these note, the android device must be connected with the digital piano.
